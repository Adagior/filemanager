With curl:

curl -fsSL https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/get.sh | bash

Or using wget:

wget -qO- https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/get.sh | bash

If youâ€™re on Windows, you can use PowerShell to install File Manager too. You should run the following command as administrator since it needs permissions to add the executable to the PATH:

iwr -useb https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/get.ps1 | iex
